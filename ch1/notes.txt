Bits is the basic unit for data representation in computer
It means binary digit

Why are characters represented with Bytes and not Bits?
1 byte is 8bits
8 bits is used as 256 different characters can be represented
    via an 8 bit binary representation

What is ASCII representation?
It serves as the standard for how characters, special symbols are 
    represented in binary(7bits)
It can be referred to as a character code standard
There are other variants of ASCII as different country needed to tweak it 
    to suit their countries language characters such as ISO 646, YUSCII


8 bit also refers to a generation of micro-computers in which 8-bit 
    microprocessors were the norm.
The first widely accepted 8bit microprocessor was intel8080

Microprocessor
CPU Architecture is based on registers
ALU Architecture is based on data buses

CPU 
    It composes of 
    Arithmetic and Logic Unit (ALU)
    Control Unit 
    Registers 

ALU 
    It is a circuit that performs different operations on data 
    such as addition, evaluation and substraction. 

Control Unit:
    The circuits co-ordinates the activities of the CPU
     It makes sure the rest of the CPU is performing their operations correctly.
     It has an instruction register 
     Look at it like music condutor with his instruction manual leading a band

A CPU that is manufactured as a single integrated circuit is known as a 
    Microprocessor.

There is common paradigm in Computer Sci 
    Actions or Operations 
    Data storage
    Management of the two listed above to make things more efficient

BUSES 
Buses are just ways for which data can be transmitted through physical arrangement
    of wires.
    It is also a collection of wires through which data is transmitted.

The size of a bus is its width
    It refers to how many bits it can transfer at a time.


The initial Architecture for Buses were
The Computer Bus is made up of the following generally known as a System Bus 
    Control Bus: It deals with operations such as reading and writing to a file. 
    Address Bus: It is used for finding specified locations 
    Data Bus: Transmission of data  

As there were improvements in circuitry 
A new architecture for Buses were made called the local Bus 
    It consists of northbridge and southbridge 

    Data transmissions are made in order of priority 

    High priority are made via the northbridge 
    Lower priority are made via the south bridge.

Addresses helps us find the location of a particular data in memory.

    It is any memory directly accesed by the CPU
